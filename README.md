wincoala is [coala](https://github.com/coala/coala) GUI for Windows. 
This program was writen for my university class of *Praktikum Basis Data*
(Object Oriented Programming Class).

### Features

- Lint source code using coala webservices without installing coala locally.
- Show list of languages and bears that coala support.
- Cache list of bears.

### Future goal

- Cache the online lint result to reduce duplicate request to webservices.
- Provide option to lint locally.
- Became a complete GUI to run coala on a local project.
